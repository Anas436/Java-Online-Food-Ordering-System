# Java-Online-Food-Ordering-System



My major focus is design and implementations an unique **Online Food Ordering System.** This system will work completely securely. It will be able to order food as per user's wish including user **Registration and Login.** Also, users can increase or decrease the food list if they wish. And this system has an **Admin panel** which will provide all the information including user **Sales Report** to the admin. This system has **Java Jframe** with **Java programming language**, **Java Swing** used. Even here **MySQL Database Connectivity** is shown through localhost. 

_More food menus can be developed in the user panel of this system including Payment Gateway, Currency Convert panel. And here only the basic operations have been done._


### There are mainly Four portion in this System following :-

  #### 	Login Form.

  #### 	Registration Form.

  #### 	User Food Order System.

  #### 	Admin Panel.

### Login Form
___________________

A login is a set of credentials used to authenticate a user. Most often, these consist of a username and password but also here I have added user role which will help to find out right user. Also here I have set the login notification which will notify individually to the user whether he has given wrong password or wrong username. If one is wrong he will not be able to enter. And here has the user role that needs to be fixed.

### Registration Form
____________________

A registration form is a list of fields that a user will input data into and submit to an individual. Most often, these consist of users basic information which will help to identify proper user. Here, I have taken some common information which is needed for each and every user. If one fields there blank instantly this system inform you so that you can not blank any fields. Also, I have attached user role which is very much important portion of this system when you can registration must be choice carefully.

### User Food Order System
_________________________

This is the main part of this system. Here in this panel only will get permission an users and other person not get permission to entry. Also, user can be order any food of their including needs when they want to do order. Moreover, when user want to increase food items and want to decrease food items. After that when they will press total button this system notify their bill individual portions. Lastly, when user will press confirm button this system justify whether food order valid or not If this process is valid then system will show congratulations message. Also there has reset and exit buttons reset button will reset all panel calculations and food items numbers and receipt message and exit button will work to perform exit operation. Additionally, I have embedded calculator which is used to calculate all kinds of calculations when the user want to calculate.

### Admin Panel
_________________

This is another important part of this system. This part contains so many values of this systems basically admin can be over control this system. Here I have included sales report portions in admin panel. When any user will confirm their order then instantly admin will get one notification report which is contain essential identities like unique serial number, user name, tax, sub total and total bill for order.
